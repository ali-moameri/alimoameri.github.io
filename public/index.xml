      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A pre-trained large language model (PLM), also known as a foundational model, is trained in an unsupervised manner on massive volumes of text data. These models exhibit a strong ability to understand natural language structure and semantics. However, in their base form, they are not directly suitable for downstream tasks. For instance, a decoder-only LLM (e.g GPT3.5), pre-trained on vast amounts of text, is primarily designed to predict the next word in a sequence. Similarly, an encoder-only LLM (e.g BERT) can interpret input text and generate context-based word embeddings, but it cannot perform complex tasks like question answering or summarization without further adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
